# Creating datasets
In order to generate the `train`, `test`, and `val` diretories, you must run certain cells in `partition.ipynb`. Run the first cell to import all the required packages. For the ASL -> English task, then run the last two cells. For the GAN task, just run the second celll.

# Training models
## ASL -> English
Simply run all the cells of `train.ipynb` to train and evaluate the ResNet-18 and Inception-V3 models. 

# Testing
## ASL -> English
Run `translte.ipynb` to trigger our live-webcam demo of ASL -> English translation.
